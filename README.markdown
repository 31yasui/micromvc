## Welcome to Micro Model-View-Controller

A tiny MVC framework crammed into less than 150kb - including documentation!

It offers Model, Library, Controller, Function, and View management. Plus other features like URI Routing, hooks/plugins, file uploads, database abstraction, captcha creation, and more! If you are new the Model/View/Controller world of OOP - then this system is for you. Every line is documented and it is as simple of a system to tear-apart as you can get.

MicroMVC is *not* a replacement for a full MCV framework. Do not plan on building the next Facebook with it! However, It is built for several reasons.

* Teach How MVC Works with a simple-to-understand code structure.
* Provide a base speed for comparing frameworks</li>
* Run small scripts and systems (like blogs) that need MVC without a lot of overhead.

MicroMVC is licenced under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html so you can use it for any personal or corporate projects free of charge.</p>

### Rquirements

* PHP 5
* mod_rewrite (apache module)
* PDO if using the Database
