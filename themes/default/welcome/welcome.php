<h2>Welcome to Micro Model-View-Controller</h2>
<b>Thank you for trying out MicroMVC</b>

<p>This is a full MVC framework crammed into less than 90kb - 
including documentation! I built this to have a base to compare 
the speed of other frameworks like CodeIgniter, Zend, Solar, and CakePHP.</p>

<p>It offers Model, Library, Controller, function, and View management. 
Plus other features like URI Routing, file uploads, database abstraction, 
captcha creation, and more! If you are new the Model/View/Controller world 
of OOP - then this system is for you. Every line is documented and it 
is as simple of a system to tear-apart as you can get.</p>
