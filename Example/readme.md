## Example Module

This module is an example of how to structure a basic application that showcases how models and the migration system are used.

To get started you need to create the migration tables using the CLI file in the root directory.

	$ php CLI Example/CLI/Run

You can then access the "School" controller to see it run through some basic use-cases.

This module is merely an example, you are **encouraged to delete it** when you are done since it is not safe for public sites.
